# COVID Credit Risk
Snowbank is offering credit products to clients in US & Canada. They are able to get KPIs for their lending activity around their outstanding balance & commit balances.

However, most financial institutions have a more holistic approach for credit risk and want to integrate global factors such as climate risk and the Covid-19 pandemics. As a result we are going to bring into Covid-19 data from the marketplace to demonstrate the ease of adding additional data sources within the Snowbank environment, and join the bank's data with the marketplace data in order to run a risk assessment of the Covid-19 pandemics to the bank's business and put a dollar figure estimate around the risk.

## Bringing in Covid-19 data
We will be using the COVID-19 Epidemiological Data by Starschema from the marketplace. The first thing you will need to do is bring that data in from the marketplace as shown in the image below. For the sake of subsequent scripts running without errors ensure you name the database ```STARSCHEMA_COVID19``` and grant it ```PUBLIC``` access.

## Create Covid-19 Risk Views
Once you have installed the Covid dataset within your account. Create a new worksheet and run the following [script](/COVID%20Credit%20RIsk/snowbank_covid_credit_risk.sqlsnowbank_covid)

This script will create the following views:
- ```COVID19_INCVACCINE_US_VW```: a Covid-19 vaccination view as of the most recent date across the US
- ```STATE_CREDIT_COVID_RISK_VW```: a combination of Covid-19 casualty, vaccination and credit data.
- ```STATE_CREDIT_RISK_COVID```: a Covid-19 credit risk view broken down by states in the USA. 

We will be using these views as the basis of any further analytics we create in the next part.

## Covid-19 Credit Risk Questions

Using the views created above along with another tables you see fit you will need to create views that answer the following questions:
1. Total number of confirmed cases
2. Total number of deaths
3. Total oustanding balance *hint: use ```CREDIT_ACCOUNTS```*
4. Total oustanding amount loans at risk ($) *hint: this is using the ```OUSTANDING_BALANCE_COVID_RISK``` column where ```est_casualty > 0```
5. % of Oustanding balance at risk
6. Oustanding balance by state and product
7. Confirmed covid cases and deaths per state
8. Vaccination campaign per state (incl ```doses_admin_total```,```doses_shipped_total```,```total_population```)

## Creating a Streamlist App

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. By using Streamlit you can quickly build and deploy powerful data applications. 

Streamlit in Snowflake helps developers securely build, deploy, and share Streamlit apps on Snowflakeâ€™s data cloud. Using Streamlit in Snowflake, you can build applications that process and use data in Snowflake without moving data or application code to an external system.

We are going to create a basic streamlit application that helps us visualise some of the COVID credit risk views that we have created. Follow the steps to create your first streamlit app:

1. Ensure you have a role that has access to the ```SNOWBANK.ANALYTICS``` schema we are going to use. 
2. Navigate to the **Streamlit** tab in the Snowsight UI menu
3. Click on **+ Streamlit App** button to create a new streamlit app 
4. Create the app with the following settings, choose whatever name you'd like to call it

5. Copy paste the template code that can be found in [streamlit_app.py](/Covid%20Risk/streamlist_app.py) to help you get started and guide you through a few steps.

You will notice that by using Streamlit in Snowflake, it already takes care of authentication and connection to Snowflake for you. 

Use the following documentation to help you build your application:
