# Lloyds Snowbank Hackathon

## Snowbank Overview
The Snowbank Financial Services Hackathon is built around a fictitious US & Canada bank, Snowbank which offers retail banking products to its 50M strong customer base in the US & Canada. Its business spans banking products (Chequing accounts, Saving accounts, Registered accounts) and also had a lending business to personal and commercial customers with a range of credit products (Credit Cards, Line of Credits, Mortgages).

#### The Snowbank Data model is the following:

The base data model is quite solid, and can be expanded to support additional use cases (Customer 360), but also regionalized by changing data in tables according to the scenario you want to customize it for.

**Below is a guide of hackathon scenarios you will be walking through:**
  1. [Loading structured and/or semi-structured data](https://github.com/snowflakecorp/frostbytes/tree/main/Industry%20-%20Financial%20Services/Snowbank/Snowbank%20Retail%20Banking) This dataset contains 50 million records of bank account records to be used as part of analysis.
  2. [Regulatory risk reporting](https://github.com/snowflakecorp/frostbytes/tree/main/Industry%20-%20Financial%20Services/Snowbank/Snowbank%20Holistic%20Credit%20Risk%20Analysis) is a massive undertaking for the bank to ensure they are compliant with regulations. Help the bank bring together their banking and customer data and subsewuently build insights that will help the compliance teams gain oversight on CDIC requirements.  
  
  demonstrates the power of the Snowflake Data Marketplace to get quick actionable insights about the Covid-19 credit risk by joining live shared data with the bank's own data.

Depending on the customer interest, both these demos can be shown to a prospect, or a combination of both. If demonstrating to a technical audience, the Snowbank Retail Banking may be more suitable. If demonstrating to a business audience, the Snowbank Holistic Credit Risk Analysis may be more suitable as it is a Snowsight dashboard based demo and focuses on actionable insights.
